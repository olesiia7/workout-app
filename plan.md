## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Notes

The app is **fully functional** for its core use case:
1. User selects workout (shoulders/glutes/correction)
2. Completes exercises one by one with weight tracking
3. Progress persists if app is closed/reopened
4. Sees success screen upon completion
5. Can navigate back to start new workout

The current implementation uses a simple but effective approach:
- **Total completed sets counter** instead of complex per-exercise tracking
- **Exercise state calculation** based on total progress
- **Purple theme** for consistent branding
- **CSS modules** for maintainable styling
- **Mock data** for development (easily replaceable with Supabase later)
